Project of about 20 hours. The purpose of this project was to get familiar with web services technologies. We had to create a simple web application with *.NET* and *JWT*. We made different micro-services such as authentification service or the game micro-service.\
We recreated the wikipedia game where you need to connect two wikipedia articles by following hyperlinks inside the articles. The project integrates a history database for finished games and a user database. Thus it is possible to manage users and saved games for administrator users (credentials admin amdin). 

Technologies used:

- .NET
- JWT
- Git

This project was made with G. Assailly, A. Mura and Y. Langlois.
